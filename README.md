## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 
 
- This project leverages the AdventureWorks dataset to analyze business operations and extract insights for a fictional bicycle manufacturing company.
- By focusing on procurement and cost control, it aims to enhance decision-making, improve efficiency, and boost profitability through data visualization and analysis tools.

### üë§ Who is this project for?  

The dashboard empowers **Purchasing Staffs** to efficiently manage costs, suppliers, and overall operations.

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  

- **Cost and Supplier Management**: How can Purchasing Staff efficiently manage costs, supplier relationships, and price discrepancies?
- **Performance and Efficiency Monitoring**: What strategies can be implemented to enhance performance monitoring and overall efficiency in purchasing operations?
- **Demand and Inventory Forecasting**: How can Purchasing Staff accurately forecast demand and manage inventory to ensure quality control and avoid shortages or excesses?

### üéØProject Outcome:  

- **Improved Standard Order Ratio**: Supplier management strategies improved significantly from 2013 onwards, increasing and stabilizing the standard order rate to an average of over 90%.
- **Effective Cost Management**: The cost discrepancy level decreased from 5% in 2011 to 2% in 2013, showing effective cost management. The Superior group of vendors demonstrated the lowest cost discrepancy rate, at 4.3%, contributing to overall cost efficiency.

## üß† Design Thinking Process  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Empathize  

‚û°Ô∏è Applied 5W1H to define the problem

| 5W1H | Answer |
|-|-
| Who will use this dashboard? <br> -> Choose only one Stakeholder | Purchasing Dept. <br> -> **Purchasing Staff** | 
| What problem this dashboard will tackle? <br> -> Describe the problem in one sentence | Monitor work performance in real-time <br>Supervise purchasing activities <br>Control prices <br>Manage suppliers <br>Forecast production demand <br>Control and forecast inventory demand <br> -> **Managing price discrepancies and overseeing raw material purchasing activities (the return rate).** |
| When and where will Stakeholders view this Dashboard? | This dashboard can be view daily on the morning and during working time. |
| Why the Stakeholders need this dashboard? | It's essential to understand the department's current performance, ascertain if efficiency targets have been met, and verify if progress is on schedule. <br>Evaluate whether the timing and quantities of orders are optimized to minimize costs (shipping costs, production volumes, etc.). <br>Ensure inventory levels are optimized (avoiding excess or shortage) to meet production demand effectively.
| How have the Stakeholders been achieving their goals so far? | Analyze and compare the cost of product materials across various vendors throughout the month.

‚û°Ô∏è Empathy Map for Stakeholders 

|EMPATHY MAP | |
|-|-|
| Pains |There is a lack of detailed work performance monitoring, making it difficult to identify if there are any issues in supplier management.
| Thinking and feeling |The team leader thinks that they need an efficient solution that enables the team to swiftly and effectively monitor and compare supplier pricing activities.
| Seeing |The team leader recognizes the potential to leverage existing data to compare the performance of various suppliers. This will provide insights into how different suppliers manage their logistics and determine if their proposed prices are competitive.
| Saying and doing |We require a report that allows for ongoing monitoring and comparison of supplier performance, and provides alerts if any supplier has pricing issues. <br> Action: Explore better tools and processes for data analysis
| Gains |Based on the report, the purchasing team can manage and collaborate with suppliers to ensure the company always acquires goods at optimal prices.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Define point of view  

‚û°Ô∏è Find the North star metric

| Questions | North star metric 1 | North star metric 2 
|-|-|- 
|What VALUE you want to measure?	| Cost | Returned Product |
|WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?	|By optimizing purchasing costs, we can minimize unnecessary expenses. | When orders are delivered accurately, in full, and without any returns. |
|Northstar Metric Name	|% Cost difference ratio | % Perfect Order Ratio |
|WHY do you choose this metric?	|Optimizing purchasing costs can lead to a substantial improvement in sales profits.| To assess supplier performance, it is crucial to track frequent under-deliveries and defective goods, as these issues can greatly affect the company's time and expenses.|

‚û°Ô∏è Dimension Data Group 

| Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 
|-|-|-
|Cost components |Vendor's Product quantity | Vendor's Orders 
|Freight <br>Tax <br>Cost Discrepancy | OnOrdering Products <br>Delivered Products <br>Rejected Products | Total orders placed with suppliers. <br>Quantity of incorrectly delivered orders (either under-delivered or delivered in full but with defects).

| The Views | Description | Why |
|-|-|-
| Overview | Time: Within the last month <br>Provides a summary of activities for the past month | To analyze recent activities within the last month
| Vendor Evaluate | Detailed information on suppliers, categorized by reliability, average delivery time, and the discrepancy between proposed and actual costs. | To understand how each supplier operates, their delivery speed, and the differences between proposed and actual prices.
| Daily KPI tracking | Access detailed information about products, including stock levels, warnings for shortages, product prices, and identifying frequently returned products. | Monitor the status of purchased goods to ensure adequacy, create warnings, and track return rates. Excessive prices can also be used to assess whether the delivery issues are due to the supplier or the product itself.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ideate  

| Idea name | Layer 0 dimension: <br> Total metric | Layer 1 dimension: <br> Breakdown the metric by 1 dimension | Layer 2 dimension: <br> Breakdown the metric by 2 dimension | Is there anything missed

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 1 Preview  

üìå Analysis 1:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22961ee-516a-40b7-86d2-1a020c849bfd)

- **Standard Order Rate:** During the period of 2011 and 2012, the standard order rate fluctuated significantly, indicating poor supplier management. However, from 2013 onwards, thanks to changes in supplier management strategies, this rate increased substantially and remained relatively stable, with the average standard order rate exceeding 90%.

üìå Analysis 2:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c71f16cb-9d80-41c0-a312-88e01e216464)

- **Cost Discrepancy Level:** This is the rate between the supplier's calculated price and the final actual cost that the business must pay, reflecting the efficiency of cost management.
- The trend shows that this rate decreased from 5% in early 2011 to 2% in 2013, indicating effective and stable cost management strategies. However, the 2013-2014 period saw significant fluctuations due to macroeconomic policy changes and market conditions.

üìå Analysis 3:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69d8fe9e-9c30-4241-8d23-114844c4b2f3)

- The data also shows that the Superior group are vendors with good cost management efficiency, with an average cost discrepancy rate of around 4.3%, the lowest among the groups. Prioritizing vendors from the Superior group, who always ensure minimal additional costs, proves to be a wise decision that brings effective cost management to the business.
